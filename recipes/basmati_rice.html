        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
                and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </li>
            
            <li>
                 Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and parsley;
                 cook for 2 minutes. Add ground turkey, salt, and garlic power. 
                 Cook and stir using a wooden spoon until meat is no longer pink and slightly browned, 
                 about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and 1/2 cup chicken broth. Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. 
                 Add cooked rice and stir stuffing well.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                 Fill each bell pepper half with stuffing and arrange neatly in a 9x13-inch
                 baking dish. Cover each pepper with a handful of shredded Cheddar cheese. 
                 Pour remaining chicken broth into the bottom of the baking dish and cover tightly 
                 with aluminum foil.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. 
                Remove foil and bake until cheese is browned, about 5 minutes more. Serve right away.
